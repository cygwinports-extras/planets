ldesc: "Planets is a simple interactive program for playing with 
simulations of planetary systems. Planets was originally designed for 
kids, in particular, for my then 4-year old nephew who is fascinated by 
astronomy. The user interface is aimed at being simple enough that a 
fairly young kid can get some joy out of it. But the adults who have 
used it have found it to be pretty fun as well."
